I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr.\ Iain Phillips, for his sharp insight into the problems encountered, and ability to suggest a good solution to them. His detailed feedback has helped me improve as a scientist and a researcher.

A special thanks to my second supervisor, Dr.\ Robert Chatley, for providing me with some key pointers on the direction of the project and its potential problems.

Last, but not least, thanks to my parents. For everything.
