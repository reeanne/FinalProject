Music games present a highly pervasive new platform to create, perform and appreciate music. In this project we will attempt creating a music rhythm game which, given a music track, extracts its features to generate a level without human intervention.

This report details the design of such a program and evaluates its effectiveness. The development of the program has lead to the discovery of new and powerful algorithms in music analysis, as well as successfully demonstrating the power of computers in developing creative works.
