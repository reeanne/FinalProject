Game developers use personal preferences and creative programming techniques and tools to develop games with the hopes of successful market penetration. Often, in the course of development, the needs of the end user are lost. 

Evaluation can occur during various times during the design and development life cycle of a game â€“ early, in the middle, late, and at the end. However, not all types of evaluation methods can be applied during all phases of design and development.
