    Index & Week commencing on  & Task  \\ \hline
    1 & 2.02 & Further research of the technologies, libraries etc.\\ \hline
    2 & 9.02 & Start developing the front end for the game. \\ \hline
    3 & 16.02 & Continue implementing the front end of the game, ask a few people to initially test the look and feel of the game. \\ \hline
    4 & 23.02 & Start implementing the melody detection algorithm -  sinusoid extraction.\\ \hline
    5 & 2.03 & Finish implementing the Sinusoid extraction and start to implement the salience function.\\ \hline
    6 & 9.03 & Continue implementing the salience function. Revision for the exams.\\ \hline
    7 & 16.03 & Revision for the exams. \\ \hline
    8 & 23.03 & Exams. \\ \hline
    9 & 30.03 & Implementing pitch contour creation. \\ \hline
    10 & 6.04 & Finish pitch contour creation, implement the melody selection. \\ \hline
    11 & 13.04 & Finish the melody selection, further develop the game to fit the retrieved data on. \\ \hline
    12 & 20.04 & Further work on integration melody into the game, testing on a small group of users. \\ \hline
    13 & 27.02 & Final touches to integration melody into the gameplay, implementing bonuses, achievements and other user centered features. Start working on the mood detection. \\ \hline
