mac old - 



done:
Crazy Train
ace of spades
Iron man
Number of the beast
Round midnight
take the a train
master of puppets
Stand by your man
he stopped loving her today
crazy
ring of fire
your cheating heart
Take Five
So what
Rock around the clock
People get ready
When Doves Cry
Fantasy
crazy in love
iris
Apologize
Hanging by a Moment
another night
blitzkrieg bop
Rise Above
Smooth
Come out and play
holiday in cambodia
this is your land
